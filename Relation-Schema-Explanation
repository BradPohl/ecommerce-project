Handle all the entities	 †
strong(non-weak) entities that are not sub-types
EVERY entity in the ER diagram is strong
strong(non-weak) entities that Are sub types
We have no subtype entities
Weak entities
We have no weak entities in our ER diagram so this part of the schema write up will be skipped

Relation schema for step 1
▶ User (UserID)
▶ Cart (OrderNO, Status)
▶ Product(ProductID,Name,Price,Quantity)


Handle all the relationships
One-to-one
We have no one to one relations

One-to-many
We have no binary one to many relations

Many-to-many
We have no many to many relations

Relationship greater than binary
▶ OrderCartUser (Date/Time,CCNumber,CVV,CCName,ShippingAddress,BillingAddress,Purchase,Status,OrderNO†,UserID†)
	->OrderNO is a primary key in this table and a foreign key from Entity Cart
	->UserID is a primary key in this table and a foreign key from entity User

▶ CartProduct (Quantity,OrderNO†,ProductID†,Status,Price,Name)
	->where OrderNO is a primary key in this table and a foreign key from Entity Cart
	->where ProductID is a primary key in this table and a foreign key from Entity Product
