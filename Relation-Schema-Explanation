FINAL SCHEMA IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS FILE, ANYTHING ABOVE IT IS THE STEPS I WALKED THROUGH

Handle all the entities	 
	strong(non-weak) entities that are not sub-types
	EVERY entity in the ER diagram is strong

	strong(non-weak) entities that Are sub types
	We have no subtype entities

	Weak entities
	We have no weak entities in our ER diagram so this part of the schema write up will be skipped

	Relation schema for step 1
	▶ BillingInfo (BillingNO,BillingAddress)
	▶ User (UserID, ShippingAddress)
	▶ Order (OrderNO, Status)
	▶ Product (ProductID, Name, Price, Quantity)

Handle all the relationships
	One-to-one
	User -> enters* -> BillingInfo
	▶ BillingInfo (BillingNO,BillingAddress, UserID†) UserID is a foreign key from User
	▶ User (UserID, ShippingAddress,BillingNO†)BillingNO foreign key from BillingInfo

	Combining the two tables above gives us
	▶ UserBillingInfo (UserID†,BillinNO†)

	One-to-many
	We do not have any one to many in a binary relation

	Many-to-many
	User -> Purchase* -> Order
	▶ User (UserID, ShippingAddress)
	▶ Order (OrderNO, Status)
	*new table made
	▶ Purchase(OrderNO†, UserID†)

	Relationship greater than binary
	See shopping cart entity
	▶ ShoppingCart(UserID†, OrderNO†, ProductID†, Price, Quantity, ItemName)
 	Where UserID is a primary key ShoppingCart relationship / foreign key from User
	And ProductID is a primary key for the ShoppingCart relationship / forgein key from Product
